        <h2>Topher Kohlstedt</h2>
        <h3>Web Developer</h3>

        In 2013, I earned my Associates degree of Applied Sciences with a focus in Web Design. In the years since, I've dabbled in several tech fields, never quite finding a position that feels right for me. The one thing that I've been consistently interested
        in is Web Development, but it always seemed unattainable. After several years, I'm finally giving it a shot.

        <p>After spending several hundred hours of tutorials and projects in my personal time, this is the first site I'm building from the ground up. This site is constantly under construction and may change drastically any moment now. Please find my list
            of projects above. These projects don't necessarily reflect my current skills as I'm constantly learning and devoting every free moment to this site.</p>

        <p>You'll also find a link to my resume in the navigation bar. I built this based on the resume generated from Indeed.com.</p>

        <p>Finally, the Contact link will open your desired application to direct an e-mail to my personal e-mail. Please reach out to me at this e-mail address with any questions. Thanks for your time! </p>
