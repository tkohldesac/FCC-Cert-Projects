        <h2>Topher Kohlstedt</h2>
        <h3>Web Developer</h3>
        <p>This is the first ever site that I'm building 100% from the ground up applying what I have learned over several projects, several hundred hours of tutorials.</p>
        <p>In 2013, I received my Associates of Applied Sciences with a focus in Web Development. In the time since, I've spent my time doing many things. I met and married my wife and have started a familiy, I've moved across the country, I've worked professionally
            as an IT technician, I've discovered new passion for several hobbies including woodworking, drawing, writing and IoT.</p>
        <p>Among these new passions, I've also discovered an old passion for web development. It seems that every free moment I get, I'm diving into Documentation, FreeCodeAcademy, Udemy and Stack Overflow trying to find new things to code.</p>
        <p>Above, you'll find a list of Projects that I've been working on. I've struggled with adding a persistent navbar that will allow a user to visit every page from every page, but it's on my list of features I need to implement. The issue is mostly
            that the pages were all built independently of each other and copying&pasting the code for the navbar on this site breaks the others. </p>
